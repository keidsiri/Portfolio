            <p class ="intro">Hi my name is Kate Kiatsiri, I grew up in Thailand and graduated in Food engineering in 2004 after I graduated I worked at Nestle(Thai) for 4 years
            before I moved to the states.Since then I have lived in Seattle and worked for restaurants. My jobs was a server, bartender and restaurant manager.
            I'm always interested in programming since Covid19 I have been learning some Python and basic Statistics.
            Many twists and turns I decided that I want to be software enginner or developer because I love to challenge myself and constantly learning with new technologies.
            I like to create some projects, applications and make a software enginner as my career.So recently I decied to join Epicodus for software developement. Please check out my porjects on github.
